# Our research project portal
We intend to use github to manage our collaborative projects with researchers that agree on our principle guidelines for cooperation on research projects.

On October 14 the Saami Council agreed on the following guidelines for our own involvement in research projects:

# Guidelines for the Sámi Council's Participation in Research Projects
These guidelines aim to strengthen collaboration between the Sámi Council and academia while safeguarding Sámi interests and prioritized research areas. The goal is to ensure a respectful and equitable relationship between Sámi stakeholders and research institutions. Any research project involving the Sámi Council's participation should provide added value to all parties involved.
## 1.	Early participation in project design
The Sámi Council should be involved in project design from an early stage, including the development of research objectives and methods.
## 2. Prioritized research areas
Research projects involving the Sámi Council should focus on and contribute to the Council's prioritized research areas, including topics such as language, culture, rights, health, and the environment. 
## 3. Ethical guidelines 
Research projects involving the Sámi Council should follow recognized ethical guidelines for research in indigenous contexts, including free, prior and informed consent, cultural sensitivity, and protection of intellectual property rights. 
## 4. Ownership and access to data
The Sámi Council should have access to and shared ownership of data and results from research projects in which they participate.
## 5. Basic knowledge of Sámi culture and society 
Researchers wishing to collaborate with the Sámi Council must have a basic understanding of Sámi culture, society, and any unique aspects related to the specific research area. 
## 6. Communication and meaningful interaction
Research projects should facilitate meaningful communication and interaction between traditional knowledge holders and academics, ensuring that both parties understand each other's perspectives and terminology. 
Time and resources should be allocated in the project budget to adequately support this communication with adequate translation services.
## 7. Capacity building and knowledge exchange
Research projects involving the Sámi Council should facilitate capacity building and knowledge exchange between the Council and research institutions, including training, workshops, and seminars. 
## 8. Communication and dissemination
Results from research projects involving the Sámi Council should be communicated in a manner accessible and understandable to Sámi communities and decision-makers. 
Research institutions and the Sámi Council should collaborate on developing dissemination strategies that include various media and formats, such as articles, reports, presentations, and digital platforms.
## 9. Long-term collaboration and partnership 
The Sámi Council and research institutions should work towards establishing long-term collaborations and partnerships to ensure continuity and sustainability in research projects involving Sámi interests and priorities. 
This may include the development of joint research strategies, collaboration agreements, and funding schemes that support Sámi research priorities.
## 10. Financial resources
Research projects should include a dedicated budget allocation for Sámi participants and the Sámi Council, covering costs related to travel, interpretation, training, working hours, and other necessary resources for the Council's participation in the project. 
The project budget should include funding for the early involvement of Sámi stakeholders in project design, ensuring that Sámi interests and priorities are considered. 
Overhead: Projects should include an overhead rate for the Sámi Council that reflects the Council's resource needs and contributions to the project. The overhead rate is in the range of 30-40% of the budget allocation mentioned in the first paragraph and comparable to overhead rates at research institutions in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Overhead will cover indirect costs associated with administration, relationship building, and project support. The exact percentage should be negotiated and adjusted based on the project's scope, duration, and complexity.
## 11. Evaluation and follow-up 
The Sámi Council should have the opportunity to evaluate and provide feedback on research projects in which they participate, which should be considered in any follow-up projects.

By following these guidelines, the Sámi Council and academia can strengthen their collaboration and ensure that research projects are more inclusive, relevant, and respectful of Sámi interests and priorities. This will also contribute to meaningful communication and interaction between traditional knowledge holders and academics, laying the groundwork for long-term collaboration and partnership.
